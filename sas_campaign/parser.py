"""sas_campaign.parser: the fence-robust statement splitter.

The C-005 lesson is the load-bearing requirement: fence robustness
first. Comments, string literals, and macro quoting must never break the
splitter's boundaries. A statement containing a comment or a string with
semicolons or comment markers survives intact.

Design: a single-pass character scanner that tracks five states (code,
double-quoted string, single-quoted string, block comment, macro comment).
Semicolons are statement terminators only in code state. The scanner emits
tokens; split_statements groups tokens into statements with source line
numbers. Statement text is the token stream space-joined with terminators
dropped: word boundaries survive, and `Statement.terminated` records
whether a semicolon closed the statement.

Fences handled:
- /* ... */ block comments (dropped, with nesting tolerance).
- %* ... ; macro comments (dropped, terminator is the semicolon).
- * ... ; single-line comments (dropped when they start a line).
- "..." double-quoted strings (SAS doubles a double quote to escape).
- '...' single-quoted strings (SAS doubles a single quote to escape).
- %STR(...) / %NRSTR(...) / %QUOTE(...) style macro quoting is treated as
  code; a semicolon inside the parentheses stays inside the statement
  because the splitter only terminates on a code-state semicolon and the
  macro function consumes the balanced parentheses. This is the fence
  tolerance the C-005 lesson demands: never let an inner fence look like
  an outer one.

The tokenizer is deterministic and pure stdlib. It does not parse SAS
grammar; it only needs to know where statements end.
