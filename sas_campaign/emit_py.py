"""emit_py: the Python emitter for the data-step subset (Track A step 3).

Translates a SAS program into Python that reproduces SAS behavior by
construction: emitted code imports the semantics reference (sas_semantics)
and calls the pinned functions for every gated construct it touches. The
plan's doctrine: a translated program is accepted because it ran and its
numbers matched, and every emitted line records where it came from.

Slice one covers the rounding program surface: DATA step framing, scalar
assignments over numeric literals and variables, ROUND (DS-012, emitted as
sas_round), and the named-list PUT rendering. Everything else becomes a
ticket: a comment at the statement site plus a Ticket record, never
generated code and never a silent drop. Later slices add merge, BY-group,
conditionals, and the rest of the fixture set.

Output rendering note: PUT is rendered at 17 significant digits, number
fidelity first. SAS's own PUT display format is a later refinement; the
translation tests pin the double, not the typography.

A ticket BLOCKS the artifact. Until 2026-09-14 a ticket was a comment at the
statement site while the rest of the program emitted and ran, so a program
whose control flow was dropped still produced an executable file that looked
like a successful translation: the IF became a comment and its body executed
anyway. A blocked unit now emits diagnostics plus a partial body that is never
called, and the module raises when executed, so the artifact and the report
cannot disagree about whether the program ran. The partial body stays readable
through translate(source, allow_partial=True), which marks the file as an
inspection artifact rather than a conversion.

Zero tickets means every semantically relevant token was accounted for. A
statement the emitter accepts and then reduces tickets rather than emitting the
reduction: `put x= "suffix"` used to emit the name and drop the literal, DATA
options were consumed as framing, and a statement the splitter could not fence
was translated whatever fragment it happened to hold. Each of those is refused
now, and the emitted artifact declares the scope it was checked against.
