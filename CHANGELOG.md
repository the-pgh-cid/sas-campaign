# Changes for 0.3.0

Status: development changes with original pins and Python/base-R evidence; no
live SAS comparison. Branch synchronization is separate from a release.

- Require typed expected comparisons, ordered rows/columns, and preserved metadata;
  make synthesis numeric tolerance explicit per family.
- Add version 2 DATA events: OUTPUT snapshots, WHERE/IF timing, BY flags, numeric
  retention, and a bounded first-iteration lookup SET.
- Preserve character widths, encodings, labels, format descriptors, and special
  missing identity. Reject unsupported conversions and ambiguous state cases.
- Keep version 1 plans readable and make C++ reject new unsupported operations.
- Add original event and metadata witnesses, base-R twins, and an operator example;
  append the gates after all original fixture gates.

# Changes for 0.2.0

Status: development changes with repository verification; no live SAS claim.

- Repair lexical fences and contextual routing; retain unsupported text as tickets.
- Add versioned operation plans, numeric Python dataset execution, and a C++17
  scalar backend with cross-backend tests.
- Add the operator CLI, installable packaging, dependency snapshot, and a composed
  rounding/sort/merge example with pinned and base-R output.
- Record source hashes, full diagnostics, and runtime versions in checksummed
  receipts; fail synthesis on incomplete execution and preserve binary64 CSV values.
- Keep the original fixture gates and extend unified verification and CI.

# Changelog

All notable changes to sas-campaign are recorded here. Versioning is semver per
`agent-manifest.json`, and the current version is `0.3.0`.

The repository carries no release tags yet, so a version named in this file
describes a state of `main` rather than a published artifact. This file was added
on 2026-09-14, and the entries below were reconstructed from the commit history of
`main`, which was the only record before it existed. Short hashes are given so
every line can be traced to its commit.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-14

### Added

- The semantics reference, the gold-pair fixture gates, and the translation
  rulebook, as the first public-ready tree (`10effea`).
- Fixture families, one construct each: Fisher's exact test `ST-014` (`f680690`),
  four-significant-figure rounding `DS-020` (`1b5f6f7`), the PROC IMPORT
  guessing window `DS-021` (`49dc089`), descriptive listing `ST-015`
  (`099eb84`), the matrix family `MX-001` (`52ea855`), and the Laplace family
  `ST-016` (`49e03d0`).
- The macro-surface frequency table across the licensed public testbed
  (`1d70bb8`).
- The translator, in steps: rulebook loader and construct map (`826d4d1`), the
  fence-robust statement splitter (`3953394`), statement text keeping token
  boundaries (`fff7d73`), and `emit_py` translating the rounding program
  (`c24b2b2`).
- `sas_campaign/test_rulebook.py`, the executable counterpart of the rulebook patterns,
  each test also asserting the pattern text so a rewording back to a wrong
  contract fails there (`7cb958d`).
- `duckdb` in the gate set, because an SQL target can only be proven in an engine
  (`7cb958d`).
- The user guide for running the gates, reading receipts, and verifying families
  (`66ccaa0`).
- The 2018 worked-example census coverage map (`3001832`).

### Changed

- Adopted the drift-management-framework: `AGENTS.md` contract, `agent-manifest.json`
  and its schema, the vendored drift linter, and both CI workflows (`43eae99`).
- Re-vendored `scripts/dmf-lint` at 2.1.0, whose floor covers all text
  artifact formats (`c6d45c7`).
- `verify_all.py` now runs 21 fixture gates and 4 translator suites, so ALL
  VERIFIED covers the translator and not only the fixture surface (`d4858e0`).
- `LICENSE` carries the operator's legal name, and local filesystem references
  were replaced in the docs, the tool defaults, and the corpus test path
  (`7fdb238`).
- The LOCAL contract now names `duckdb` in the gate set and the gate that covers
  translation (`e4ac22a`, `d4858e0`).

### Fixed

- The rulebook's four wrong targets: `DS-006` filled inside the aggregation,
  `DS-007` prescribed a full-column shift for a conditional LAG, `DS-009` required
  last-value aggregation where LET is the contract, and `SQL-001` claimed
  CALCULATED aliases work unchanged in DuckDB (`7cb958d`).
- `DS-007` now routes a conditional LAG call to review as well as modelling it
  (`bb5b6c7`).
- A ticket blocks the artifact instead of commenting on it, so a program whose
  control flow was dropped no longer emits a file that looks like a successful
  translation (`f0e0a89`).
- The emitter refuses a statement it cannot fully account for rather than reducing
  it (`b8ba85e`).
- The outside review P1 pair: zero-and-retained weights, and QTR SAME
  month-anchored (`5121aef`).
- Em dashes stripped from the shipped rulebook to meet the style floor (`e33d53b`).
- Agency provenance stripped from the brief, and DSEP naming dropped from the
  significant-figure surface (`b478cd5`).

### Removed

- The Rosetta brief left the public tree (`5534ab9`).
