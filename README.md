# sas-campaign

Reproducing SAS behavior in open languages (Python, R) with receipts.

The quiet workhorse underneath the legend: the toolchain behind the sas-ref corpus.
This repository holds the migration toolchain: reference implementations of
SAS semantics, gold-pair fixtures that prove cross-language agreement, and
the rulebook for translating SAS constructs. The corpus it is tested against
lives in the sibling repository, [sas-ref](https://github.com/the-pgh-cid/sas-ref).

The core claim: a translated program is accepted because it ran and its
numbers matched, not because it looked right. Every fixture gate in this
repository demands byte-equal output between the Python and R translations,
checked against hand-pinned truth and the semantics reference.

## Operational workflow

The typed execution workflow and C++ scalar pilot use a shared, versioned
operation plan. See [Operations](docs/OPERATIONS.md) for installation, the CLI,
explicit scope, receipts, and peer synchronization. The composed example in
`examples/workflow/` runs rounding, sorting, and a one-to-many merge against a
pinned result and a base-R counterpart. Python executes bounded typed datasets;
C++ currently supports scalar DATA _NULL_ programs. Julia remains an extension
option. Algorithm redesign must preserve a stated behavior contract.


The [stateful execution contract](docs/STATEFUL_EXECUTION.md) adds typed expected
comparisons, explicit OUTPUT snapshots, WHERE/IF timing, retained variables, and
character/metadata preservation. `examples/events/` provides a runnable job with
fixed expected output and base-R evidence. Special missings retain their tags.

## Layout

- `sas_semantics.py` : reference implementations of SAS-quirk functions
  (round half away from zero, INTCK/INTNX, missing-value ordering, character
  truncation, merge mechanics, formats, and the family). The verifier's law.
- `examples/` : gold pairs. Each SAS construct gets a faithful Python and R
  sibling plus a fixture verifier (`verify_*.py`). Run any verifier directly,
  or all of them through `verify_all.py`.
- `docs/sasconversionrulebook.json` : the machine-consumable translation
  rulebook. 56 rules with equivalence classes (EXACT,
  EQUIVALENT-WITH-SETTINGS, APPROXIMATE, NO-DIRECT-EQUIVALENT), required
  settings, forbidden patterns, and validation tests.
- `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` : the user guide: running the gates, reading the
  receipts, understanding the equivalence classes, and verifying a new
  construct family.
- `sas_campaign/` : the program-level translator package (Track A). `parser.py`
  preserves statement fences, `rules.py` loads the rulebook and
  routes constructs, and the shared plan drives Python typed dataset execution
  and a C++ scalar backend. Tests: `sas_campaign/test_parser.py`,
  `sas_campaign/test_rules.py`, `sas_campaign/test_emit_py.py`.
- `kb01/sas_semantics_reference.txt` : the semantics reference as plain
  text, for humans and for diffs.
- `manifest.py` : pin a SAS corpus with content hashes and provenance.
- `synth.py` : program-level synthesis across characterized construct
  families, seeded and deterministic. Runs cross-language and reference
  gates; the live-SAS capture stage is optional and license-gated.
- `verify_all.py` : runs every fixture gate, emits a checksummed receipt JSON.
  One command, the whole proof.
- `tools/macro_census.py` : token census of the macro surface across the
  licensed public testbed, deterministic, pure stdlib. Outputs the
  frequency table in `docs/macro_surface_census.md` plus a CSV.
- `docs/macro_surface_census.md` : the macro-surface frequency table with
  method and NOTICE (which public repos were counted, under which
  licenses). Data about code, never code itself.
- `AGENTS.md` : the agent contract under the drift-management-framework, the
  Matthew Haubach principal GLOBAL plus this project's LOCAL layer.
- `agent-manifest.json` : machine-readable project descriptor, validated
  against the bundled schema in CI.
- `scripts/dmf-lint` : the DMF invariant linter (fences, pointers,
  manifest shape, status lines, style floor). Runs in CI on every push.

## Running the gates

Requires Python 3.11+ and R (for the R halves of the gold pairs).

```sh
python verify_all.py
```

Each verifier also runs standalone, e.g. `python examples/verify_merge.py`.
The R interpreter is found via `ROSETTA_RSCRIPT`, then `Rscript` on PATH.
`verify_all.py` writes its receipts under `telemetry/` (gitignored).

## Known landmines (why the gate exists)

- Ordinary equality can accept true as 1, and string conversion can accept text
  "1.0" as numeric 1.0. Typed comparisons reject both; row/schema order and metadata
  matter too (`sas_campaign/test_compare.py`).
- LAG and DIF are queues, never column shifts. Each occurrence carries its own
  queue of depth n, and the queue advances where the CALL RUNS rather than
  where the row exists, so a conditional call returns the value at the previous
  EXECUTION. On values 10, 20, 30, 40 invoked only on rows two and four, SAS
  returns missing then 20 where the shift model returns 10 and 30. A missing
  argument is still an execution, which makes a skipped call and a call with a
  missing argument different histories (`verify_lag.py`).
- Explicit OUTPUT disables automatic output even when its branch is skipped.
  WHERE runs before BY groups form; subsetting IF runs afterward. Input/retained
  variables survive iterations while scratch variables reset (`verify_events.py`).
- Character byte widths affect assignments. Losing leading zeros, missing tags,
  labels, or format descriptors changes the typed result (`verify_metadata.py`).

- SAS `round(x, unit)` rounds half away from zero; Python and R round half
  to even by default. A naive translation disagrees with SAS at every
  half-unit boundary.
- R `ifelse` evaluates both branches whole-vector; the SAS ladder short
  circuits. Naive translations diverge on out-of-range branches.
- SAS missing values sort first and compare low; NaN and NA do neither
  consistently.
- Significant digits are a rounding problem, not a format problem: SAS has
  no %g, so sig figs mean ROUND to an explicit power-of-ten unit (half away
  from zero). R signif() and Python %g round half to even, so 0.125 at two
  digits is 0.13 in SAS and 0.12 in both open languages.
- PROC IMPORT guesses CSV types from a 20-row window; pandas and R infer
  from the whole file. A column that looks numeric early but carries a
  string at row 500 reads NUMERIC in SAS (string becomes missing) and
  character in pandas/R. Pin the divergence per file; never trust either
  default. Leading-zero identifiers strip in all three engines: read them
  as character explicitly.
- PROC FREQ percents are three separate denominators (cell, row, column),
  one decimal, missing levels excluded. R factors materialize zero-count
  levels as NaN rows that SAS never lists; pandas 3 omits them. And
  crosstab margins combined with normalize sums normalized values, never
  SAS totals. Compute margins from counts.
- Laplace noise is a distribution problem, not a generator problem. SAS
  PDF('LAPLACE', x) with the default location 0 and scale 1 is a density
  value, a constant; the 2018 origin guide's workaround added that
  constant as its noise. Draw streams are incomparable across engines, so
  the gate proves the deterministic surface (PDF, CDF, QUANTILE, and the
  inverse-CDF sampling construction) and never compares draws.
- Matrix operators lie across languages. IML's `*` is matrix
  multiplication and `#` is elementwise; R and numpy read `*` as
  elementwise (`%*%` / `@` are the products). IML fills matrices
  row-wise; base R fills column-wise. A singular inverse fails
  differently in each engine. The matrix gate pins the 2018 worked
  examples (product `[[50,21],[24,10],[101,42]]`, inverse
  `[[3,-2],[-7,5]]`) and never emits a bare star for a SAS product.

## Origins

This project is the open-source realization of a concept that predates it
by eight years: the Rosetta Wiki, an internal wiki of side-by-side
SAS, R, and Python examples built to move statisticians off SAS. The
concept and its worked-example pattern are documented in:

> Rosetta Wiki 1.0 User Guide: Companion to Rosetta Wiki. Nelson Chung,
> Steve Clark, Philip Leclerc, Aref Dajani, Phyllis Singer. Research
> Report Series (Disclosure Avoidance #2018-02), Center for Disclosure
> Avoidance Research, U.S. Census Bureau. September 2018.

The lineage is conceptual only. Nothing in this repository is copied from
that work; every implementation here is original, and the difference is
the doctrine: the 2018 wiki compared examples against hand-pinned
desired results by eye, while this repository demands executable
byte-equal gates with receipts. One continuity check: the 2018 Fisher
worked example pinned a two-sided p-value of 0.1238 on its 2x2 fixture,
and every engine pinned in this repository reproduces it exactly.

A task-level coverage map of that census, cross-referenced to the rules
and gates here, lives at
[`docs/rosetta_wiki_coverage.md`](docs/rosetta_wiki_coverage.md).

## Provenance

The verification method: published SAS outputs and documented behavior
first, cross-language agreement second, and capture against a live
licensed SAS runtime as the last mile where available.
Nothing in this repository is a verified claim until it has passed the
fixture gate; the receipts are the current evidence.

## Governance

This repository is governed under the
[drift-management-framework](https://github.com/the-pgh-cid/drift-management-framework)
(DMF 2.0), file-based governance for projects worked on by humans and agents
together. The contract is [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md); the machine-readable
descriptor is [`agent-manifest.json`](agent-manifest.json), validated against
[`agent-manifest.schema.json`](agent-manifest.schema.json) in CI; and the
invariants are checked by
[`scripts/dmf-lint`](scripts/dmf-lint) on every push:
fences, pointers, manifest shape, status lines, and the style floor of no em
dashes and no ellipses in artifacts.
