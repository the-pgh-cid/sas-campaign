# Stateful execution and typed comparison, 0.3.0

Status: executable development contracts, original pins, and Python/base-R
witnesses. No live SAS capture. Maintainers may use these results to review the
bounded operations below; they do not establish equivalence for arbitrary jobs.

## Run the event example

```sh
sas_campaign inspect examples/events/job.sas
sas_campaign run examples/events/job.sas --inputs examples/events/inputs.json --expect examples/events/expected.json --output telemetry/events-review
```

The example reads a configuration row once, filters the driving input before BY
groups form, resets a retained total at each group boundary, and writes five
snapshots from three selected input rows. The scratch variable is missing after
the first iteration. The second configuration row is never consumed. Fixed
expected values and an independent base-R implementation gate the result.

## Plan version 2

A single simple DATA destination is supported. `OUTPUT;` and `OUTPUT name;`
snapshot the current PDV immediately. Any explicit OUTPUT in the step disables
implicit end-of-iteration output, including an OUTPUT in a false IF branch.
A snapshot already written survives a later failed subsetting IF.

The driving `SET name;` precedes computations. One optional
`IF _N_=1 THEN SET lookup;` can precede that SET. The lookup reads its first row
once; an empty lookup ends the step without output. Input variables retain their
values between iterations until a SET or assignment overwrites them. Ordinary
assignment variables reset to missing. `RETAIN name number;` and
`RETAIN name .;` initialize a numeric variable once; a repeated initializer uses
the last declaration. Uninitialized RETAIN lists are not implemented.

`WHERE predicate;` selects driving input rows before group formation. It can
reference only columns in that input. Subsetting `IF predicate;` runs in source
order after the input read and group flags. An ascending BY list after SET
provides `_N_`, `FIRST.key`, and `LAST.key`; flags propagate when a preceding
BY key changes. Automatic variables are excluded from output schema and rows.
`_N_` is also available without BY. Inputs must be sorted after WHERE selection.

Predicates accept a numeric truth value or one comparison (`=`, `^=`, `~=`, `<>`,
`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, and EQ/NE/LT/GT/LE/GE). IF THEN accepts one assignment or
OUTPUT. Expressions accept atoms, two-argument ROUND, and `variable + atom` or
`variable - atom`. Implicit character/numeric conversions are refused.

Declarations and input descriptors establish column order and types before row
execution, including empty outputs and assignments inside skipped branches.
Version 1 serialized plans remain executable. The C++ pilot retains its scalar
numeric scope and blocks the new event, metadata, and expression operations.

## Typed catalog and metadata

Existing `"column": "number"` schemas remain supported. Descriptors can declare
`type`, `length`, `label`, and `format`:

```json
{
  "a": {
    "encoding": "utf-8",
    "schema": {
      "id": {"type": "character", "length": 3, "label": "Identifier", "format": "$3."},
      "day": {"type": "number", "length": 8, "format": "DATE9."},
      "reading": "number"
    },
    "rows": [{"id": "007", "day": 0, "reading": {"missing": "A"}}]
  }
}
```

SET, SORT, and OUTPUT preserve column descriptors. This transport contract also
carries the source table's optional label and encoding. Copying a variable by
assignment copies type and width, not its label or format. A format descriptor
is retained as metadata; the executor does not render SAS formats or infer a
date from one. Named-list PUT uses raw numeric values and trimmed character text.
The base-R metadata witness checks descriptors, byte counts, and value identity;
it is not a SAS-file reader or a metadata interchange library comparison.

Character lengths are bytes. `LENGTH name $ width;` must precede SET and
computations; otherwise the first literal assignment establishes width. Values
are blank-padded and subsequent assignments truncate to that width. A truncation
that splits a multibyte code point raises an error. Imported values exceeding
the declared width also fail instead of losing data. Supported encodings are
UTF-8, ASCII, and Latin-1; mixing input encodings requires explicit transcoding.
Character comparison pads the shorter operand with blanks. Sorting uses the
ordinal character order for these encodings, without linguistic collation.

Numbers are binary64. Ordinary missing is JSON null. Special missings use
`{"missing":"_"}` or uppercase A through Z, and literals `._`, `.A` through `.Z`.
Identity survives transport, assignment, and output; numeric order is underscore,
ordinary missing, A through Z, then finite numbers. Arithmetic with any numeric
missing yields ordinary missing. Boolean, text, non-finite, malformed, or
out-of-range numeric inputs fail validation.

## Comparison policy

CLI expected-output checks compare numeric values exactly, preserve type
boundaries, require row cardinality/order and schema column order, and compare
all descriptors and table metadata. JSON object property order within individual
rows is irrelevant. Integer 1 and binary64 1.0 are the same numeric value;
boolean true and string "1.0" are different. Comparisons do not round a large
integer to a float before checking it.

Synthesis remains an explicitly numeric CSV bridge. Its six families require
ordered rows and columns; CSV NaN and null represent the same ordinary missing.
Only rounding uses absolute tolerance 1e-10; the other five families use exact
numeric comparison. Every family prints its policy into the verification receipt.
CSV inference is not evidence of character, label, format, or tagged-missing
preservation; those use the typed catalog witnesses.

## Remaining boundaries

Multiple DATA destinations, general conditional SET, DO/ELSE loops, sum
statements, LAG translation, macro execution, raw INPUT, format rendering, and
linguistic sort orders still require review. Character BY key width changes are
refused. MERGE retains its ordinary numeric, sorted, at-most-one-repeating-side
scope; tagged/character inputs, filters, explicit retention, and assignments to
MERGE input variables are refused. Modeling writes to MERGE input variables
requires a separate merge read-event implementation.

sas-kb research IDs SL003, SL004, SL005, SL006, and SL020 motivated these original
witnesses. They are not held-out SAS outputs, and the five imported mirrors were
not modified. The operational code and gates live in this repository; the
knowledge-base research lives in sas-kb.
