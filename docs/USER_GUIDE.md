# sas-campaign User Guide

Reproducing SAS behavior in open languages (Python, R) with receipts.

This guide is for anyone using sas-campaign: running the fixture gates,
reading the receipts, and understanding what this repository proves and
does not prove. It is the companion to the [README](../README.md). The
verification method itself is documented in the repository history; the
doctrine lives in the gate suite and the receipts.

## What sas-campaign proves

sas-campaign proves that specific SAS constructs behave the way this
repository says they do in Python and R. The proof is executable: every
construct family has a fixture gate that pins hand-derived truth, runs the
Python reference implementation and the R twin, and requires byte-equal
agreement at a documented tolerance. A claim in the README or the rulebook
is only as good as the gate behind it.

The core doctrine: a translated program is accepted because it ran and
its numbers matched, not because it looked right. The receipt is the
evidence; the gate suite is the proof; nothing is verified by assertion.

## Repository layout

- `sas_semantics.py` : the reference implementations of SAS-quirk
  functions. This is the law the verifiers check against.
- `examples/` : the gold pairs. One SAS construct family per fixture:
  a Python verifier (`verify_*.py`), an R twin (`*.R`), and in most cases
  fixture data embedded in the verifier.
- `docs/sasconversionrulebook.yaml` : the machine-consumable translation
  rulebook. 56 rules across data-step (DS), PROC SQL (SQL), statistical
  procs (ST), survey procs (SV), the macro layer (MC), and the IML
  matrix surface (MX), each with an
  equivalence class (EXACT, EQUIVALENT-WITH-SETTINGS, APPROXIMATE,
  NO-DIRECT-EQUIVALENT), required settings, forbidden patterns, and
  validation tests.
- `docs/macro_surface_census.md` (+ `.csv`) : the macro-surface frequency
  table. Data about code, never code: which macro features appear in the
  licensed public testbed, at what density, and under which licenses.
- `docs/rosetta_wiki_coverage.md` : the 2018 worked-example census mapped
  to current coverage: which rule or fixture gate carries each example.
- `kb01/sas_semantics_reference.txt` : the semantics reference as plain
  text, for humans and for diffs. It stays in lockstep with
  `sas_semantics.py`.
- `manifest.py` : pin a SAS corpus with content hashes and provenance.
- `synth.py` : program-level synthesis across characterized construct
  families, seeded and deterministic. Runs cross-language and reference
  gates; the live-SAS capture stage is optional and license-gated.
- `tools/macro_census.py` : the deterministic, pure-stdlib scanner that
  regenerates the macro-surface census.
- `sas_campaign/` : the program-level translator package (Track A). `parser.py`
  is the fence-robust statement splitter, `rules.py` loads the rulebook
  and routes SAS statements and function calls to rule families, and
  `emit_py.py` emits Python for the data-step subset (slice one: the
  rounding fixture). Tests in `sas_campaign/test_parser.py`,
  `sas_campaign/test_rules.py`, and `sas_campaign/test_emit_py.py`.
- `verify_all.py` : runs every fixture gate, emits a signed receipt JSON.
  One command, the whole proof.
- `telemetry/` : run artifacts (receipts, run records). Gitignored;
  rerun `verify_all.py` to regenerate.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+ with numpy, pandas, scipy, and PyYAML. A venv with the
  gate stack (for example `.venv` beside this checkout) carries it.
- R (for the R halves of the gold pairs). `Rscript` must be on PATH, or
  set `ROSETTA_RSCRIPT` to the full path. The R interpreter is found via
  `ROSETTA_RSCRIPT`, then `Rscript` on PATH.
- No other runtime dependencies. The linter and the census tool are pure
  standard library.

## Running the gates

One command, from the repository root:

```sh
python verify_all.py
```

Use the venv python that has the gate stack, for example:

```sh
python verify_all.py
```

A bare system python3 without numpy and pandas produces phantom
`ModuleNotFoundError` failures that look like gate regressions; check the
traceback type before chasing a failure.

What you will see:

```text
[PASS] rounding_n: VERIFIED: translation matches SAS semantics on all fixtures
[PASS] merge: VERIFIED: MERGE BY matches the PDV rule and agrees Python/R
...
receipt -> telemetry/verify/receipt_2026-09-10T124918Z.json
ALL VERIFIED
```

`ALL VERIFIED` is the bar. `SOME FAILED` means at least one gate failed;
the failing construct names appear in the output.

Each verifier also runs standalone, for example:

```sh
python examples/verify_merge.py
```

## Reading the receipts

Each run writes a receipt JSON to `telemetry/verify/` named with the UTC
timestamp:

```json
{
  "ts_utc": "2026-09-10T12:49:18Z",
  "host": "local",
  "tool_git": "826d4d1",
  "constructs": [
    {"construct": "rounding_n", "verifier": "verify_rounding.py",
     "passed": true, "summary": "VERIFIED: ..."}
  ],
  "all_passed": true
}
```

- `tool_git` pins the receipt to the exact commit that produced it.
- `constructs` is one entry per fixture gate with a pass/fail and the
  final summary line.
- `all_passed` is the verdict. Judge by `all_passed` in the newest
  receipt when multiple runs exist; cite receipts by timestamp.
- The same run appends a compact record to `telemetry/runs/runs.jsonl`
  with an output sha256 prefix.

Receipts are run artifacts and are gitignored; they are never committed.
They regenerate every run, so the deliverable is the ability to reproduce
them, not the files themselves.

## Running the translator package tests

The rulebook loader and construct router carry their own unit tests,
run against the shipped YAML:

```sh
python -m unittest sas_campaign.test_rules -v
```

28 tests: rule count and uniqueness, family counts, ticket semantics for
NO-DIRECT-EQUIVALENT rules, construct-map integrity, statement routing
(PROC SORT, TRANSPOSE, FREQ, SQL with INTO and remerge hints, GLM, macro
statements), and function routing (ROUND, INTCK, LAG, TRANWRD, SUM).

The parser and the translation lane carry their own suites:

```sh
python -m unittest sas_campaign.test_parser -v
python -m unittest sas_campaign.test_emit_py -v
```

`test_parser` proves fence robustness, including across the 56-task Roku
corpus; `test_emit_py` translates the rounding fixture, runs the emitted
program, and requires its output to match the semantics reference and a
frozen pin.

## Running the macro-surface census

```sh
python3 tools/macro_census.py
```

Regenerates `docs/macro_surface_census.csv` and
`docs/macro_surface_census.md` from the licensed public testbed
(point `--testbed` at your checkout of it). Deterministic: identical output on
identical input. The private bench under `testbed/local/` is never written
to the shipped output; `--include-local` prints a private comparison to
stdout only.

## What the equivalence classes mean

- `EXACT` : the open-language implementation reproduces SAS output to the
  documented precision (often 1e-10 or tighter) with the settings the rule
  names. No settings negotiation.
- `EQUIVALENT-WITH-SETTINGS` : the open-language implementation matches
  SAS once the rule's required_settings are applied. The settings are
  mandatory, not advisory; omitting one is a defect.
- `APPROXIMATE` : the open-language result is close but not guaranteed
  identical (for example factor rotations, some ESM paths). The rule
  names the tolerance and what may differ.
- `NO-DIRECT-EQUIVALENT` : no open-language construct reproduces SAS here.
  The rule is a ticket: emit a human-review ticket, never generated code.

## What routes to a ticket

The translator's v1 scope is data-step only. Constructs without a direct
equivalent and every family that is not yet gated route to a human-review
ticket rather than generated code:

- Merge with both sides repeating BY values (DS-003): a data property,
  detected by per-key group-size cross-tab at runtime, never by statement
  shape.
- CALL EXECUTE and dynamic code construction (MC-004): detection and
  ticket only, by ruling.
- PROC SQL remerge (SQL-002): flagged by the aggregation-with-detail
  pattern.
- Survey selection at the seed level (SV-006): inclusion probabilities
  validate, individual draws never.
- PROC IML (GP-09, MX-001): routes to human review, except the pinned
  matrix surface (concatenation, transpose, multiplication, the 2x2
  inverse) carried by the matrix family.

## Verifying a new construct family

A new family lands as the seven-file change set, and every gate must pass
before it is real:

1. `sas_semantics.py` : the reference function(s), with a section comment
   naming the SAS surface and the landmine.
2. `kb01/sas_semantics_reference.txt` : the same in plain text, same pass.
3. `examples/<fam>.R` : the R twin.
4. `examples/verify_<fam>.py` : the gate. Reference pins first, then R
   lane agreement, then landmine demonstrations.
5. `docs/sasconversionrulebook.yaml` : the rule entry.
6. `verify_all.py` : register the verifier in the VERIFIERS list.
7. `README.md` : one known-landmine bullet.

Pins come from three engines agreeing (pure reference, scipy, R) before
anything is written; a gate whose pins came from one engine is a
tautology. Every family pins at least one landmine case: a value where
SAS and the naive open-language default disagree.

The full recipe lives in the project skill (sas_campaign-gate-families) and the
verifier skeletons in its references.

## The style floor

Every artifact that leaves this repository follows the drift-management-framework
floor: no em dashes, no ellipses. The floor is enforced by the linter
(`scripts/inertia-drift-lint`), never by hand. The linter also checks
balanced DMF fences, link-pointer integrity, manifest schema, and
status-line presence. It runs on every push in CI.

```sh
python3 scripts/inertia-drift-lint .
```

## Known landmines (why the gate exists)

The README carries the current list. The shape of the list:

- SAS `round(x, unit)` rounds half away from zero; Python and R round
  half to even by default.
- R `ifelse` evaluates both branches whole-vector; the SAS ladder short
  circuits.
- SAS missing values sort first and compare low; NaN and NA do neither
  consistently.
- Significant digits are a rounding problem, not a format problem.
- PROC IMPORT guesses CSV types from a 20-row window; pandas and R infer
  from the whole file.
- PROC FREQ percents are three separate denominators (cell, row, column).
- Laplace noise is a density value, a constant, not a draw; draws are
  never compared, only distributions.
- Matrix operators lie across languages: IML's star is a product, R's
  star is elementwise; fill order diverges (row-major vs column-wise).

## Troubleshooting

- `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'` : you are using a bare
  system python3. Use the venv python that carries the gate stack.
- `Rscript not found` : install R (on Debian/Ubuntu:
  `apt-get install r-base-core`) or set `ROSETTA_RSCRIPT` to the full
  path.
- `receipt ... crashed` on a fresh clone : the telemetry directories were
  missing in an older version; run `mkdir -p telemetry/verify telemetry/runs`
  or update past the fix in verify_all.py.
- A gate fails after you changed `sas_semantics.py` : the kb01 plain-text
  mirror must change in the same pass; the two are in lockstep by design.
- The linter flags an em dash in a file you did not touch : the file
  predates the floor; fix the character, do not add an ignore.
