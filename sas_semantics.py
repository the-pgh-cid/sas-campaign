# Type coercion. SAS silently converts between character and numeric. The
# high-frequency landmine is CHARACTER TO NUMERIC: when a character value is
# used where a number is expected (arithmetic, a comparison against a number, an
# assignment to a numeric variable), SAS strips leading and trailing blanks and
# reads the value with the standard numeric informat. A value that is blank or
# does not parse as a standard number becomes MISSING; SAS sets _ERROR_ and logs
# a note, but execution continues. A naive translation reaches for float(x),
# which RAISES on exactly the blank and non-numeric rows SAS turns to missing,
# so the translation crashes where SAS quietly drops the row and keeps counting.
# It composes with the missing-is-smallest rule: a coerced-to-missing value
# sorts first and fails an ` > n` test, dropping out of a filtered group the way
# SAS drops it. The standard informat does NOT read commas, dollar signs, or hex,
# so "1,000", "$5", and "0x10" are missing, not 1000, 5, and 16. (R's native
# as.numeric would read "0x10" as 16; the reference rejects it, so the two
# translations agree on the SAS rule rather than on either host's default.)

# deliberately not gated yet: its exact field width wants a SAS console pin
# before it enters the deterministic core.

# down the group, output at LAST.id. FIRST.var/LAST.var follow the BY PREFIX: for
# BY a b, FIRST.b is set whenever the pair (a, b) differs from the previous row,

# RETAIN across groups: a translation that forgets the FIRST.-reset accumulates a

# statement also treats a missing addend as zero, tying back to missing handling,

# PROC SORT ordering. 499 programs, 27 percent of the public corpus, carry
# sort-dependent constructs (sort-risk probe, 2026-07-15), and three rules
# diverge from both pandas and R defaults. (1) MISSING SORTS FIRST: numeric
# missing orders below every number, negatives included; pandas puts NaN last
# (na_position default) and R puts NA last (na.last default), both the exact
# inverse. Under DESCENDING the whole order reverses, so missing lands LAST,
# which naive na_position juggling also gets wrong. (2) EQUALS IS THE DEFAULT:
# PROC SORT preserves the input order of ties (SAS 9.4 Procedures Guide, PROC
# SORT statement, EQUALS|NOEQUALS). Independent drafts disagreed on this exact
# pin (one asserted NOEQUALS), which is why it is taken from the documented
# spec and proven by fixture, not by vote. pandas sort_values defaults to an
# unstable quicksort. (3) BYTE COLLATION: default SORTSEQ compares bytes,
# case-sensitive, "B" < "a"; R consults the locale unless the sort runs with
# method="radix" (C-locale, stable), which is the R twin's whole trick.
# Character comparison pads the shorter operand with blanks, so trailing
# blanks NEVER order two values: the key strips them and 'a' vs 'a ' is a tie
# resolved by stability (and a duplicate to NODUPKEY, which keeps the FIRST
# occurrence in sorted order). Numeric-as-character sorts lexically by byte
# ('10' < '2'), the classic trap, inherited faithfully by treating char as
# char. Special missings (._ below . below .A through .Z, all below every
# number) are documented but NOT implemented: pandas and R collapse them to
# NaN on read, a recorded lossy edge, to be characterized if the corpus ever
# exercises it. SORTSEQ=LINGUISTIC is likewise out of scope, recorded.

# Numeric precision and storage (quirk 10). SAS stores every DATA-step numeric

# real divergences. (1) INTEGER EXACTNESS ends at 2**53: Python ints are
# arbitrary precision, so 2**53 + 1 survives a Python int but collapses to
# 2**53 through any SAS numeric (IEEE round-to-even at storage); translations
# that keep IDs in int silently diverge from the SAS dataset. (2) LENGTH
# TRUNCATION: LENGTH 3 through 7 stores a numeric by TRUNCATING low-order
# mantissa bytes at dataset write (SAS Language Reference: Concepts, numeric
# precision; the documented largest-exact-integer table pins the rule). No
# pandas or R equivalent, and NO draft dossier surfaced it, which is itself a
# finding: the deadliest precision landmine is the one nobody drafted for.

# quirk 1, already gated half-away (one dossier re-asserted bankers and is

# WEIGHT semantics (quirk 12, second half). PROC MEANS with a WEIGHT variable.
# (1) THE EXCLUSION AND CONVERSION RULES: a MISSING weight excludes the
# observation. A NEGATIVE weight is converted to zero while the observation
# is RETAINED in the count, which is what the EXCLNPWGT option proves when it
# drops nonpositive weights entirely (documented; outside review 2026-09-13,
# P1; live-SAS receipt pending, probe p13). A zero weight therefore
# contributes nothing to the sums but still counts toward n, which silently
# changes the VARDEF=DF divisor: the subtlest consequence and a pinned
# fixture. (2) THE DIVISOR SET: VARDEF=DF divides the weighted CSS by n-1
# (observation count, not weight sum), N by n, WDF by sum(w)-1, and WEIGHT by
# sum(w). One dossier offered sum(w) - sum(w^2)/sum(w) for VARDEF=WEIGHT:
# that is the effective-df of reliability weights, a real statistics concept
# hallucinated into SAS, refuted by the documented set. (3) ZEROED ROWS STILL
# COUNT: once negative weights are converted to zero the weighted CSS cannot
# go negative; the retired reading carried negative weights numerically and
# returned missing for the std, superseded by the documented behavior above.
# (4) PROC FREQ's WEIGHT sums possibly non-integer weights into cell counts,
# missing weights excluded, and levels whose total weight is zero drop from
# the table by default (the ZEROS option exists to keep them). Weighted
# skewness and kurtosis are deferred, documented: the SAS weighted
# higher-moment formulas need their own spec pass.

# one for the other; the pair is pinned side by side. (4) COMPARISONS TREAT
# MISSING AS SMALLER THAN EVERY NUMBER: "if x < 0" CATCHES missing x in SAS,
# silently does not in Python (NaN comparisons are all false), and yields NA
# in R (filters drop the row); missing EQ missing is TRUE in SAS where
